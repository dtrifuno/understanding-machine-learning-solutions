\chapter{The VC-Dimension}

\begin{ex}
  Suppose not, i.e.\ suppose that $\H'\subseteq \H$, but $\VCdim(\H')>\VCdim(H)=n$. Then
  there exists some set $C\subseteq \X$, with $|C|=n+1$ that $\H'$ shatters.
  However, since $\H'\subseteq \H$, it follows that $\H'_C\subseteq \H_C$ and
  therefore $\H$ also shatters $C$, contradicting the assumption that $\VCdim(\H)=n$.
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item[]
    \item Let $n$ be the cardinality of the domain set $\X$. Then, the
          VC-dimension of $\H^\X_{=k}$ is $\min(k, n-k)$.

          First, note that it is never possible to shatter a set of $k+1$ points, since there is no
          $h\in\H^\X_{=k}$ such that $h(x)=1$ for $k+1$ different points. Likewise,
          it is never possible to shatter a set of $n-k+1$ points, since if a
          hypothesis assigns the value $1$ to exactly $k$ elements, it must assign
          the value $0$ to exactly $n-k$ elements, and hence there is no hypothesis
          corresponding to the constant $0$ function.

          Next, suppose that $k\leq n-k$. Let $C=\{p_i\}_{i=1}^k$ be a subset of $\X$,
          and note that for any $v\in\{0,1\}^k$, we can construct a hypothesis $h(p_i)=v_i$, since we
          know that at most $k$ of the $v_i$'s are going to be $1$, and that there are
          at least $k$ more elements in $X\setminus C$ that we can map to $1$ in order to
          satisfy the condition on the hypothesis space.

          Finally, suppose that $n-k\leq k$. Let $D=\{p_i\}_{i=1}^{n-k}$ be a subset of $\X$,
          and note that any function $h:D\to \{0,1\}^{n-k}$ is in $H^\X_{=k}$, since
          $|D|=n-k\leq k$, and hence $h$ can assign the value $1$ enough times and
          $|\X\setminus D|=n-(n-k)=k\geq n-k$, and hence $h$ can assign the value $0$
          enough times.
    \item Let $n$ be the cardinality of the domain set $\X$. Then
          \begin{align*}
            \VCdim(\H^\X_{\text{at-most-$k$}})=\begin{cases}
              n & \text{if $n\leq 2k+1$}, \\
              k & \text{otherwise}.
            \end{cases}
          \end{align*}

          First, note that if $n\leq 2k+1$, then for every $f\in \X^{\{0, 1\}}$, it is
          either going to take on the value $1$ at most $k$ times, or the value $0$ at most
          $k$ times, and hence is in $\H^\X_{\text{at-most-$k$}}$.

          Next, suppose that $n>2k+1$. Note that it is never possible to shatter a set $C$ of
          $k+1$ points, since a function that returns $1$ for the $k+1$ elements of $C$ will have
          to return $0$ for the remaining $|\X\setminus C|>k$ elements, and thus is not of the
          hypothesis class.

          Finally, note that if $C=\{p_i\}_{i=1}^k$, we can always construct a hypothesis
          $h(p_i)=v_i$ for any $v\in \{0,1\}^k$, by specifying that $h(x)=0$ if $x\in \X\setminus C$
          and observing that $h$ then assigns the value $1$ at most $k$ times.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
  Note that there is a one-to-one correspondence between hypotheses in $\H_{n-\text{parity}}$
  and subsets of $[n]$, by mapping each hypothesis $h_I$ to $I\subseteq [n]$.
  Hence $|\H_{n-\text{parity}}|=2^n$, and it follows
  by the VC-dimension bound on finite classes that $\VCdim(\H_{n-\text{parity}})\leq n$.

  To show that the VC-dimension is $n$, it remains to show that the hypothesis class
  can shatter a set of cardinality $n$. Let $C=\{e_i\}_{i=1}^n$,
  the set of unit vectors, and note that for any $v\in \{0, 1\}^n$, if we define
  $I=\{i\in [n]\mid v_i = 1 \}$, the hypothesis $h_I$ maps $e_i$ to $v_i$. Hence
  $\H_{n-\text{parity}}$ shatters $C$.
